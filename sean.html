      <p style="color: orange;"><strong><em>About me</em></strong></p>
    <p style="color: orange;">Hello my name is Sean and I'am a 16 year old boy who likes to play videogames and listen to music. I live in sweden and love it here. </p>
      <p style="color: orange;"><strong><em>Eperiences</em></strong></p>
    <p style="color: orange;">I would say that I'am fairly decent at html and somewhat of a beginner at css. I have no other experience with other coding languagues. I'am very good at video games as of 2018 I won a monitor worth around 550$ by only getting 1 try to get a win and the most kills and I did.</p>
      <p style="color: orange;"><strong><em>What I've learned</em></strong></p>
    <p style="color: orange;">I have not learned so much just some tags and what they do. I remember mostly all of my webcoding from when i was younger and making websites. I have also learned some of the different files types and what's the difference between them. I have yet to learn so much more.</p>
      <p style="color: orange;"><strong><em>What I want to learn</em></strong></p>
    <p style="color: orange;">I don't know yet what I want to learn but I would like to advance my coding skills and I would also like to be able to write code in python and other coding languagues.</p>
